🚀 Leonardo Ferreira | Backend Developer

Backend Developer focused on Java 8+, Spring Boot, Maven, JPA/Hibernate, MVC, RESTful APIs, and PostgreSQL. I’m committed to building scalable, maintainable applications by applying solid object-oriented design, clean architecture, and software engineering best practices.

I’m building real-world backend projects, sharing my progress, and learning from every obstacle. Along the way, I'm applying concepts like Test-Driven Development (TDD), software design patterns, exception handling, Docker, and basic CI/CD setups. I'm also working toward mastering tools like Swagger, Lombok, JUnit/Mockito, and more.
