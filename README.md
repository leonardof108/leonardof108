## 🌟 About Me

I'm a **System Analysis and Development** student building a strong foundation in **backend development, DevOps, and software engineering**. My focus is on writing **clean, scalable, and reliable systems** while continuously expanding my skills.

Right now, I’m:
### ✅ Developing backend systems with Java and Python.
### ✅ Exploring DevOps & Cloud – learning CI/CD, Docker, and AWS.
### ✅ Studying software engineering principles – clean code, SOLID, testing, and agile methodologies.

Beyond coding, I’m fascinated by **infrastructure as code, automation, and system reliability** and working on projects to put these concepts into practice.

## 🎯 My Goals

I’m working towards becoming a **backend + DevOps engineer**, focusing on high-quality **software delivery, system reliability, and cloud automation**. My learning is hands-on, driven by real-world projects and continuous improvement.
